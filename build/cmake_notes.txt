OUTPUT of CMAKE - Notes

From the build directory run cmake and pass the path to the source directory
i.e. the directory with the top level CMakeLists.txt file.
    
For a fresh project run the following commands:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..

This is assuming you have already written the CMakeLists.txt file in the
starting directory.

These commands generate 3 files and a directory.

    $ ls
    
    CMakeCache.txt
    cmake_install.cmake
    Makefile
    CMakeFiles/

The CMakeCache.txt is analogous to a config file which stores global variables
that describe the project. 

The Makefile is the file that was generated for make.
